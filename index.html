	<h1>Intro Profile</h1>
	<p>Hello there, my name is Isaac Kozma Kelly (Student ID ….) and this is a brief overview of who I am, what’s my background and other fundamental information about me.
I was born in Melbourne Australia where I have lived most of my life, my parents are African American and Hungarian, a very bizarre mixture but I love the mass difference in culture as its allowed me to see life from so many different angels. At home unfortunately I only speak English however I can understand basic Hungarian. An interesting fact about me is that I play American football (Gridiron) which allowed me to gain a scholarship for my last year of high school where I played for Layton Christian Academy in Utah. Before the Covid-19 pandemic I was inline to play college football in California for East Los Angeles college, unfortunately those plans where ruined due to the state America was in, however I am still forever grateful for the experiences I gained because of football, I was able to complete life goals that otherwise would’ve been unattainable.

	<p>IT has always interested me, ever since I was young I loved playing games and being on the computer, some of my earliest memories are me at my grandparents playing a pinball game on their computer. Whenever I was younger I never really thought about how computers worked I only liked what they allowed me to do however in the last half decade or so I’ve become more invested on how the devices I use everyday work and if it would possibly be a area of work I’d be interested in. I feel over the past 18 months my interest of IT increased dramatically as the pandemic gave me a new outlook on life and my future, with football being taken out of my hands as a career I began to consider IT more than I ever which led me to enrol into the Bachelor of IT with RMIT.</p>
	<p>Due to the pandemic, I figured if I was to study it would be best to go with a school that has proven that they can teach online as I’ve heard many horror stories from friends that have been studying online and how unorganised it’s been. From the research I’ve done I found that Latrobe and RMIT where the two best schools when it comes to online studying, they where both on Open Universities as well, I chose RMIT purely because I have known a few friends that have studied there.</p>
	<p>Throughout my studies at RMIT I hope to learn a vast amount, I want to know that when I’m done with this course I’ll be competent in the work place and be able to get the job I wanted to. I am more interested in the coding side of IT as I know a couple of people who do that as a profession and they all rave about it. </p>
